# Learncpp tutorial repository

Hi and welcome!

The purpose of this repository is to learn the programming language C++, with the help of the online learning portal www.learncpp.com.
This is a personal experience, and as I work through the learning material at the mentioned website, I will be pushing the examples 
-- with extensive commenting -- to this repository. You can share and reuse this repository if you wish.

If you have suggestions as to how the code can be improved or if you find bugs, please commit a change or submit an issue, respectively.

For those interested, I use the [CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ "JetBrains Homepage") by JetBrains, who also develop the Intellij IDE, which you might've heard of. Alongside CLion, I use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/ "MinGW Homepage") as compiler. 

I primarily develop on Windows 10, but I have [Linux subsystem for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about "WSL Homepage") installed, so I occasionally use the Linux terminal for simplicity, which you should definately check out if you haven't already.

Enjoy!
